# HangmanPy
In this little project I developed a classic game called hangman in Python. The words in the `words.txt` document were taken from a database of 5000 words, which are the most commonly used in English, and the words such as the adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions were eliminated.  It's just for fun so have fun! :)

You can play the game online on [Repl.it](https://repl.it/@hevalhazalkurt/HangmanPy).
